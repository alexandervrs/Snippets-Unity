/* -----------------------------------------
   Audio
----------------------------------------- */

* Gap between music loops

	a. MP3s have a default gap to their sides and cannot loop seamlessly, use OGG or WAV for music files

* Gap when trying to play a music loop after a music intro section

	a. Use audioSource.PlayDelayed() instead of Play() with a custom delay, this eliminates any gapping
	
* Crackling when playing sounds

	a. Fix Audio Latency
	   Go to Edit > Project Settings... > Audio
	   Under "DSP Buffer Size" option select either "Good Latency" or "Best Performance"
	
* Audio doesn't play when loaded from AssetBundle & shows "Error: Cannot create FMOD::Sound instance"

	a. Check if the AudioClip is using "Streaming" setting and change it
	

/* -----------------------------------------
   Camera
----------------------------------------- */

* Camera contents are not visible

	a. Check the Z order of the Camera
	b. Check that the Culling Mask includes the Layers you are trying to render
	c. Check that the Near and Far Clipping Planes include the GameObjects you're trying to render
	
	
* Cannot do special effects like shaking the Camera while also moving it

	a. Use a parent GameObject for the Camera as a pivot and move that instead for special effects like that
	
	
/* -----------------------------------------
   Timing
----------------------------------------- */

* Framerate locked

	a. Disable Vsync and Target Framerate with: QualitySettings.vSyncCount = 0; Application.targetFrameRate = -1;
	

/* -----------------------------------------
   Tiles
----------------------------------------- */

* Tiles show seams/gaps between each tile when moving or zooming the Camera

	a. Create a SpriteAtlas and add the tiles to it, change the "Padding" setting accordingly
	
	
/* -----------------------------------------
   Particles
----------------------------------------- */

* Particle System is not visible

	a. Check the Layer, Sorting Layer and Order under the Particle System's "Renderer" module
	b. Check the Z order
	c. If in Canvas, check that the Canvas has the right Layer/Sorting Layer/Order & Override Sorting flag enabled
	   Also check the GameObject's scale
	d. Check if "Play On Awake" is enabled in the Particle System and it has fired once already out of view
	e. Timing issues, a Sequence that never reaches a particular frame, so the Particle System never fires
	f. Check if anything is making the GameObject, that is holding the Particle System, not Active
	
	
* Particle System particles are not dense (or have gaps, especially for trail-style effects)
	
	a. Check the ParticleSystem's "Max Particles" property, maybe the system has reached its limit
	
	
* Particle System cannot appear over other UI elements

	a. Use a parent Canvas element with Override Sorting setting to overlap UI elements manually
	   

/* -----------------------------------------
   Material & Shaders
----------------------------------------- */
	
* Shader not found or is null, or Material cannot be created

	a. Check String namespace in Shader for typos
	b. Check if Shader is compiled. Unity will not compile and include Shaders that are not referenced somewhere.
	
		To reference and compile a Shader, do one of the following:
	
		* Drag and drop a Material asset that uses the Shader you want in a public variable field of a GameObject in the Scene
		* Use an invisible GameObject with a Sprite or Mesh Renderer that references the Material that uses the Shader you want
		* Include the shader in a ShaderVariantCollection and use Warmup(), if Asset Bundle references a Scene, the Shader and ShaderVariantCollection needs to be loaded from another AssetBundle, as Scene Asset Bundles cannot include any resources that the Scene is not referencing
		* Place the Shader inside a "Resources" folder, that will force compile the Shader but also cause it to be included in the main application, it is maybe not ideal if you want to include the Shader in an Asset Bundle
	
	c. Check if Shader is inside correct and loaded AssetBundle
	d. Check if Shader is supported with shader.isSupported before using it and provide fallback
	

* Applying a Shader effect to a full Texture shows a part of a Sprite Atlas
	
	a. In the Texture Import Settings change "Wrap Mode" to "Clamp"
	
	
* Applying a Shader effect does not affect the entire Texture area

	a. In the Texture Import Settings change "Mesh Type" to "Full Rect"

	
/* -----------------------------------------
   GameObjects
----------------------------------------- */

* GameObject is not visible in 2D projection, even with negative Z and correct  SortingLayer/Order

	a. Check that GameObject's Scale Z is not 0


/* -----------------------------------------
   UI
----------------------------------------- */

* UI element is not being scaled or anchored correctly

	a. Make sure you're pressing Shift &/or Alt when choosing the Anchor Preset on a Rect Transform to also set pivot and position

	
* UI element graphic seems to interact weird with a shader overlay (e.g. jagged pixely or miscolored edges)

	a. Set a Material to the UI component, e.g. Sprites-Default, so the shader can interact with it properly
	

/* -----------------------------------------
   Animator / StateMachine
----------------------------------------- */

* Animation State has a weird waiting time after it is seemingly done

	a. Check if your problematic animation State has a fixed Exit Time set


/* -----------------------------------------
   Scripting
----------------------------------------- */
	
* Building fails on iOS

	a. Make sure you're not using the keyword "dynamic" as iOS does not allow dynamic code generation
	
	
* No Autocomplete in VSCode
	
	a. Make sure the C# Omnisharp extension package name hasn't changed, otherwise manually install a VSIX of older version
	b. Install required Dot Net SDK for the C# extension to work
	c. Delete all .csproj files in the project folder so Unity can regenerate them
	

/* -----------------------------------------
   Editor
----------------------------------------- */
	
* Unity does not open Scene and Prefabs normally but tries to open them in the default text editor instead

	a. Update Visual Studio Code package using the Package Manager

	
/* -----------------------------------------
   DOTween (Third Party)
----------------------------------------- */

* Catmull Rom DOPath() with custom path points doesn't seem to follow the correct curve

	a. Make sure the starting point [0] and final point [1] are set in the array *first*, then the in-between points
	
	
* Tween doesn't play

	a. Make sure Autoplay is turned on in DOTween Settings or manually play the Tween using Play()
	

* PrependInterval() and SetDelay() doesn't work in a Sequence

	a. SetDelay() and PrependInterval() only work if you're using Join() and Append() for your keyframes. Using Insert() and InsertCallback() will ignore PrependInterval() & SetDelay().
	   Use a custom offset for that, e.g. sequenceName.Insert(startDelay+3, ...)
