/* -----------------------------------------
   Audio
----------------------------------------- */

* Gap between music loops

	a. MP3s have a default gap and cannot loop seamlessly, use OGG or WAV for music files

* Gap when trying to play a music loop after a music intro section

	a. Use audioSource.PlayDelayed() instead of Play() with a custom delay, this eliminates any gapping
	
* Crackling when playing sounds

	a. Fix Audio Latency
	   Go to Edit > Project Settings... > Audio
	   Under "DSP Buffer Size" option select either "Good Latency" or "Best Performance"
	

/* -----------------------------------------
   Camera
----------------------------------------- */

* Camera contents are not visible

	a. Check the Z order of the Camera
	b. Check that the Culling Mask includes the Layers you are trying to render
	c. Check that the Near and Far Clipping Planes include the GameObjects you're trying to render
	
	
/* -----------------------------------------
   Timing
----------------------------------------- */

* Framerate locked

	a. Disable Vsync and Target Framerate with: QualitySettings.vSyncCount = 0; Application.targetFrameRate = -1;
	

/* -----------------------------------------
   Particles
----------------------------------------- */

* Particle System is not visible

	a. Check the Sorting Layer and Order under the Particle System's "Renderer" module
	b. Check the Z order
	c. If in Canvas, check that the Canvas has the right Sorting Layer/Order & Override Sorting flag enabled
	   Also check the GameObject's scale
	d. Check if "Play On Awake" is enabled in the Particle System and it has fired once already out of view
	e. Timing issues, a Sequence that never reaches a particular frame, so the Particle System never fires
	f. Check if anything is making the GameObject, that is holding the Particle System, not Active
	   

/* -----------------------------------------
   Material & Shaders
----------------------------------------- */
	
* Shader not found or is null, or Material cannot be created

	a. Check String namespace in Shader for typos
	b. Check if Shader is referenced in a Material, otherwise needs to be inside a "Resources" folder in order to be compiled or in a ShaderVariantCollection
	   Unity will not compile and include Shaders that are not referenced somewhere. Materials created via script using Shaders never used anywhere else are prone to this
	c. Check if Shader is inside correct and loaded AssetBundle
	d. Check if Shader is supported with shader.isSupported before using it and provide fallback
